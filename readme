This repository contains code for some of the analyses in my upcoming book "Deutsche Sprachgeschichte. Grundzüge und Methoden" (Tübingen: Narr) as we. As the book is in German, most comments in the code are in German as well as the digital material that accompanies the book. While the book will be under standard copyright, the materials in this repository can of course be freely used and redistributed.
